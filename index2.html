					In the past, I worked for an incredible (but sadly now defunct) print-only magazine that went by the name of <i>Specimen Magazine</i>. I had the privilege of working with some of the most brilliant minds alive today. I was granted entry to the 2014 Turing Award Ceremony at UCLA since I was interviewing that year's recipient of the award, Judea Pearl, who received it for his contributions to Artificial Intelligence, namely the <i>do-calculus</i> he invented. I worked with people I consider to be geniuses in their fields: from Matthew Lieberman in advertising and persuasion to discussing the creation of the internet with Leonard Kleinrock.
